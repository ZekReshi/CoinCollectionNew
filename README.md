# Coin Collection Web Page
This is a web page for my coin collection.
It consists of a front end website developed using Vite+React and a backend written in C# using ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework.

## Execution
Please see the README.md documents in the frontend and backend folder.

## Login
The users in the database are added manually, but generating a salted password hash might be too tedious for some.
To circumvent the login and get a JWT token anyway, use username: admin, password: admin.
